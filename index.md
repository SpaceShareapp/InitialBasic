SpaceShare is becoming a mobile application that will help therapists to maximize their office space.  With SpaceShare, therapists can easily rent out their office space whenever they are not using it. Likewise, SpaceShare makes it easy for therapists to pick up office space day to day, as needed.

SpaceShare strives to create a transparent and respectful private-office networking system. Our platform will include user profiles, images and detailed listings of each space. User rating systems and badges will ensure accountability and cleanliness between users.

SpaceShare offers discounts for both Early Adopters and referrals.  Become an Early Adopter and receive transaction discounts.
