# InitialBasic
This will be my initial webpage to introduce SpaceShareapp to the world. The concept of SpaceShare came about after the COVID-19 lockdown... I had been in the middle of a structural bodywork therapy trade.  The therapist I was trading with had let go of his office after a few vacant months out of work.  Although I knew of many therapists in the area, I was having trouble finding an office space to work in.  And what came to my mind was "Why isn't this an app?" So, I ran it by my brother, who is in the IT industry.  He is capable and interested in the project. So here we are, making it happen.
